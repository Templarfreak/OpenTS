```ini title="theme.ini"
[INTRO]
Name=Intro
Length=3.27
Normal=no
Repeat=yes
```

The routine that decides what plays next skips a track that is not normal. It is also left out of the track list on the sound options screen, so a player cannot pick it there either. It can still be started outright by name, which is how the menu and map selection music reaches the player without ever appearing on the playlist.

The same routine also applies [`Scenario`](/keys/scenario/#scope-themes) and [`Side`](/keys/side/#scope-themes), and drops any track whose audio file is missing from the mixfiles.
