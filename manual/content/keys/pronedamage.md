The scaling is applied only to an infantryman that is lying down, only to damage above zero, and only to damage that is not [forced](/keys/c4warhead/). Forced damage passes at its full figure however low the fraction. The fraction comes off before the [`Verses`](/keys/verses/) table is applied, so the table multiplies the figure that is left. The scaled figure is truncated to a whole number and then raised to at least one, so any positive hit still costs a prone soldier a point of strength.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[MyGasWH] ; example WarheadType
ProneDamage=300% ; a gas that pools where a soldier is lying
```

A value above one raises the damage instead of lowering it. The percentage form is divided by 100 as it is read, so `300%` and `3` are the same setting.

A [`Webby=yes`](/keys/webby/) warhead zeroes the damage of any soldier its web catches after this scaling has been applied, so the setting changes nothing there. A soldier with [`IsWebImmune=yes`](/keys/iswebimmune/) is not caught, and keeps the scaled figure.
