[Reveal around waypoint...](/mapping/actions/taction-reveal-some/) is the only reader. The reveal is centered on the waypoint's own ground level, raised by the bridge height when the waypoint lies under a bridge. The [height test](/keys/revealbyheight/) that blocks a reveal behind high ground applies, so a waypoint at the foot of a cliff uncovers less than the radius names.

The value is a plain count of cells and shares the sight scan's cap of ten cells, so a larger value uncovers ten. The action uncovers the ground for every human player except one who has already been given full vision.
