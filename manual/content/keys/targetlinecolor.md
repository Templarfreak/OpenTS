The three numbers are separated by commas; a value that is not three numbers keeps the default, a dark red. A number outside 0 to 255 wraps around, so 300,0,0 is read as 44,0,0. The squares on the line's ends take the same color. The target line runs from a selected object's firing point to what it is attacking; [Action lines](/systems/action-lines/) covers when it is drawn.
