With the flag set, the track that has just been started queues up again as its own successor, so it plays until something else interrupts it. A track whose theme entry sets [`Repeat=`](/keys/repeat/) does this regardless of the flag.

The flag is also what suppresses the choice of a next track: while it is set, neither the sequential order nor the shuffled pick of [`IsScoreShuffle`](/keys/isscoreshuffle/) is read.

The sound options dialog shows the two as check boxes that turn each other off, so the dialog can never set both. A file that sets both is read as written, and repeating wins because the next track is never chosen. Leaving the options screen writes both flags back to `sun.ini`.
