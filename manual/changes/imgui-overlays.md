A Debug build with the debug keys armed shows a frame benchmark window on F6, drawn over the game and its menus. The window reports the logic frames and presents of the last second, and the frame benchmarks the events page shows.

The window takes the mouse only while the pointer is over it, and the keyboard only while one of its fields has focus. Everything else reaches the game.

A Release build has no overlay.
